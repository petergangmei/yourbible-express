# Changes Made to Resolve Database Issues

## Issue Identification

The API initially encountered errors when trying to connect to the database. After analysis, we identified three key issues:

1. **Schema Conflict**: The database already contained tables from a Django application, causing conflicts with our Prisma migrations.
2. **Multi-schema Feature Issues**: The Prisma schema was using the `multiSchema` preview feature which was incompatible with our database configuration.
3. **Database Connection Parameters**: The connection string needed to be updated to specify a schema to avoid conflicts.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Multi-schema Preview Feature

We modified the Prisma schema to remove the `multiSchema` preview feature and all schema-specific annotations:

```diff
generator client {
-  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
-  previewFeatures = ["multiSchema"]
+  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
-  schemas  = ["bible_api"]
}

model Language {
  // ... model definition ...
-  @@schema("bible_api")
}
```

### 2. Updated Database Connection String

We added a schema parameter to the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to isolate our tables:

```diff
# Database Configuration
- DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
+ DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database?schema=bible_api"
```

### 3. Created and Applied New Migrations

We created a new migration with the `--create-only` flag to review it before applying:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name bible_api_tables --create-only
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 4. Seeded the Database

We successfully seeded the database with example Bible data:

```bash
npm run seed -- scripts/example-bible-data.json
```

## Results

All API endpoints are now functioning correctly:

- The Bible data is properly stored in the `bible_api` schema
- All endpoints return the expected data
- Search functionality works correctly
- Swagger documentation is accessible

## Documentation Updates

We added a "Known Issues & Solutions" section to the README.md file to help future developers who might encounter similar issues.

## Commit Message

"Fix database schema conflicts and connection issues by using schema parameter instead of multi-schema feature"
